Introduction
============
Welcome to the _Xerus_ project. Xerus is an open-source python wrapper / plugin around the GSASII Scriptable package,
for automazation of phase quantification and Rietveld analysis by combinining similarity calculation of simulated patterns
(Pearson`s) with quick Rietveld refinements.

_Xerus_ is only possible due to the existence of the following projects
* COD (Crystollographic Open Database)
* The Materials Project (MP)
* AFLOW Database
* OQMD (Open Quantum Materials Database)  
* GSASII Scriptable Engine
* pymatgen

_Xerus_ is designed to perform analysis through __Jupyter__ notebooks, providing an easy to use API from phase quantification to Rietveld optimization

The main mechanisms behind _Xerus_ stems from the following papers:

* __Clustering of XRD patterns using similarity__:
    * Iwasaki, Y., Kusne, A.G. & Takeuchi, I. Comparison of dissimilarity measures for cluster analysis of X-ray diffraction data from combinatorial libraries. npj Comput Mater 3, 4 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-017-0006-2

* __Optmization of Rietveld refinements__:
    * Ozaki, Y., Suzuki, Y., Hawai, T. et al. Automated crystal structure analysis based on blackbox optimisation. npj Comput Mater 6, 75 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-0330-9

Plus our own pattern removal iterative process coupled with quick rietveld refinements that allows for multiphase characterization.


Installation
============

In this section we will briefly introduce how to install _Xerus_ in the easiest manner possible.
## Requirements
### Before installing Xerus OS and Services Requeriment:
#### System OS
* _Xerus_ only supports Linux based and macOS systems.
_Xerus_ was mostly developed in __Ubuntu 20.04__ and have been also tested in __CentOS 7.x__ and __MacOS systems (Intel)__ (M1 machines not available for testing.)
```diff
- We have not tested in Windows OS yet.
```

#### Materials Project APIKey
Xerus relies on the Materials Project API for downloading crystal structures with requested chemical space.
Therefore, please register and obtain an suitable API key (Free) at: \
www.materialsproject.org \
After registering, you can check your API Key by clicking the API tab at the upper right side of the website.

##### MongoDB
_Xerus_ relies on a MongoDB server for caching crystal structures downloaded from the providing databases (COD, AFLOW and MP) \
To install the community version (Free) and run please follow the steps listed in:
 * [Ubuntu Installation Steps](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
 * [MacOS Installation Steps](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

## _Xerus_
### Package Installation
_Xerus_ currently can only be installed via conda. Therefore, if you do not have conda, please follow the install instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). \
To install _Xerus_ using a virtual enviroment with Python 3.8 follow this steps:

```
conda create -n Xerus python==3.8 anaconda
conda activate Xerus
git clone http://www.github.com/pedrobcst/Xerus/
cd Xerus
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> :warning: You might have trouble installing pymatgen if gcc is not present in your system. You can them for example do sudo apt install g++ to install in Ubuntu, then run pip install -r requirements.txt again. 


### Configuration

If all the packages installation are successful, it is needed to correctly set the configuration file at `Xerus/settings/config.conf`:

#### Necessary
* __[mongodb]__
  * _host_: defaults to _localhost_
    * Enter ip address to mongodb server.
  * _user_: username (if necessary)
    * If configuraed to use authentication, please provide the username here
  * _password_: username password (if necessary)
    
* __[mp]__
  * _apikey_: Materials project API key.
    * Please provide your materials project API key here
  
#### Optional
* _Extra_ config:
  * __[gsasii]__ 
    * _instr_params_: Path to .instrprm (GSASII)
      * _Xerus_ by default comes with an .instprm file obtained from fitting NIST Si in our XRD Machine (Rigaku MiniFlex 600).
  It is _recommended_ that you follow the GSASII tutorial for obtaining an .instrprm for your own machine but probably not necessary.
      
    * _testxrd_: 
      * _Xerus_ by default use one of the _Examples_ data for testing purposed of obtained CIFs from the repositories. Feel free to change this to any of your liking

### Testing installation

If all the above steps were done sucessfuly (pip install, mongo running [locally] and API key set),
please do the following:
```bash
cd tests
pytest
```
If all tests sucessfuly pass, _Xerus_ should be ready for use.

> :warning: This process might take a while. 
# Usage

- To learn how to use Xerus, please follow the Notebook, located at Examples/Examples.ipynb

> :warning: Make sure that before running the examples, you have started the MongoDB server.
